# QuantAQ

This repository contains an analysis of QuantAQ air quality monitor sensors. I access the monitor data through QuantAQs API and R wrapper. The specific monitors that I access in my R markdowns are part of a fleet of monitors in Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia. These monitors are not available to the public, but creating a QuantAQ account allows you to access a suite of public monitors.
